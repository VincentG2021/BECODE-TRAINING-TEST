## The Internet and the World Wide Web are not the same.

To help understanding the basis about the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) and what is a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network), watching this short video from Aaaron Youtube channel can help : [How the Internet Works in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc&ab_channel=Aaron).
 
### Nowadays :
[Telecoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication) are working mostly with wires on and under earth, [submarine wires](https://submarine-cable-map-2020.telegeography.com/) and [satellites](https://satmap.space/).

#### More and more :
- Internet has spread and can be used for new [purposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things).
- The World Wide Web is also still in constant [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0).


As I'm curious, I often can explore a lot of websites to find "some" infos about...everything !

But, as I discover contents, images, texts, videos, sounds,... covering what was/is/will be the Internet, but also other "things/topics", I still feel :
"it's not easy to manage the time trying to learn and to transmit knowledge, but it worth it." :octocat:

Before the next update of this page, I'd like to share this [link](https://veillecarto2-0.fr/) to a collaborative french website about cartography, something that I found exciting too... :smile:

✨Enjoy !✨
